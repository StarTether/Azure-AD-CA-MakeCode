  "description": "This policy requires admins to always use strong credentials and for their access to be monitored by Microsoft Cloud Access Security. If these admins try to access the organization from an untrusted or uncharacteristic location or even outside corp. premises, additionally, they're required to use a secure device, without which access will be blocked. If they're trying to access the system from disallowed countries otherwise, their access will be blocked and key people will be notified.",

  "name": "Employee Protections",
  "description": "Okay, this is a complex policy. Ready? Here we will allow Employees to view files on M365 without any friction if the detected risk is low. If the risk is medium, then they can either use strong creds, or secure devices, or secure applications to view. In the absence of all of these, someone has to approve their access and then their session will be monitored closely. However, high risk views are blocked and the right people are notified.   If the user is trying to do something other than read (ex. download or create or delete) - then, if they're coming in from trusted locations and the detected risk is low, then they can either use strong creds or their session is monitored closely and someone is notified. If the low risk user is not coming from a trusted location, then their session is secured more thoroughly. However, medium or high risk access is blocked for these high privilege actions.",
